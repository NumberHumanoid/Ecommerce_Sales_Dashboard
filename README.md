# Sales Dashboard


## Business Request
**Client:** *AdventureWorks*, a global leading bicycle manufacturing company.

**Request Overview:** 
The sales manager, *Steven Fuentes*, has identified a need for enhancing the company's sales reporting system. The current system, which relies on static reports, is to be upgraded to interactive visual dashboards. These dashboards will be utilized by the sales teams for deeper insights.
### Specific Requirements:
1. **Sales Analysis:** The dashboards should enable an analysis of product sales, client engagements, and sales trends over time.
2. **Customization:** Each salesperson handles different products and clients. Hence, the ability to filter data based on specific products and customers is crucial.
3. **Performance Tracking:** The sales team benchmarks their achievements against set budgets. The dashboards should allow for comparison between actual sales figures and budgetary goals. Note: Budget data for the last two years is available in a provided `.csv` file.

**Objective:** The primary goal is to empower the sales team with dynamic and interactive tools for enhanced decision-making and performance tracking.
